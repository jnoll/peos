IMPLEMENTATION:

The PML User's interface is implemented in Tcl/Tk version 8.0. Version 8.0 
or greater must be used since the namespace construct, which first
appeared in version 8.0 of Tcl/Tk, is used throughout the source code to
provide some encapsulation between components. 

The PML User Interface uses a text-based socket through the uiEngConn
namespace to communicate with the PML Engine Component, which runs as a 
daemon on a PML remote server (which was oslab-server this semester).

The PML User Interface uses a configuration file to start. The file
is usually named ".pmlrc" and can be located in either your
$HOME directory on Unix or C:\ on MS Windows platforms.
This file contains default information such as the engine host, port number, 
and web browser command. If no config file is found the default settings are 
used. (Engine Port: 14175, Engine Host: oslab-server.cudenver.edu, WebBrowser:
netscape). The config file setting can be modified using the Customize Option 
from the Options Menu. These options can be set or preserved by using the Open
or Save options from the File Menu.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS:

The script which starts the PML User Interface is pmlUI.tcl. Currently,
all eighteen tcl scripts should be located in the same directory where you wish
to run the PML User Interface. The following command-line options can be 
specified. All the command-line arguments listed below are optional.

-f <configfile>   With this option the User can specify a configuration file 
                  to start the User Interface. If this option is not used a 
                  .pmlrc file will be used in the local directory. 
                  If a .pmlrc file is not found there one in the $HOME 
                  directory will be used. If a .pmlrc file is not located 
                  in the $HOME directory, then internal default settings will 
                  be used.

<hostname>:<portnumber>  The host name and the port number of the engine can
                         be specified. This command-line setting will be used
                         for connecting to the Engine and will override any 
                         Engine settings in the configuration file specified.

-debug            This option will print useful debug information to stdout
                  such as UI/Engine Message traffic socket status and the results
                  of message parsing and generation.

-test             This option will create a test menu which will display all of
                  screen not readily available without an engine connection.
                  This was mostly used to test the layout of the screens and to
                  provide screen captures for the documentation group.

Example Command Line:

         ./pmlUI.tcl oslab-server.cudenver.edu:14175 -debug


MODULE DESCRIPTION:

Each module represents a Tcl/Tk namespace construct. There
are currently thirteen different modules.

     
Module Name:   Files:                  Module Description:
     
actionHandler  actionHandler.tcl       The module handles the execution of
                                       Tools or Scripts sent by the Engine.
                                       The module also has the capability of
                                       spawning a Web Browser with a specified
                                       URL. The module is not yet called by
                                       any other PML UI module.

dynamicWidgets dynamicWidgets.tcl      This module handles the construction
                                       of screens on the right side of the PML
                                       UI. The messageMgr components determines
                                       which routine in this and has the
                                       appropriate screen construct based on
                                       data in the uiValues component.

persistentWidgets persistentWidgets.tcl This module handles the login screen
                                        construction along with the status 
                                        information displayed at the bottom
                                        and on the left screen. 

messageMgr     messageMgr.tcl          This module is called by the parser
                                       module and based on the message sent
                                       by the parser the messagerMgr determines
                                       which screens should be created.

inputValidator inputValidator.tcl      Retrieves user input from the screen
                                       places it in the uiValues component
                                       and calls the generator with a message
                                       indicating which message to generate.

generator      generateMesg.tcl        Retrieve user input from the uiValues
               extractName.tcl         set by the inputValidator constructs
               buildMesg.tcl           the outgoing message, and sends the
                                       outgoing message to the uiEngConn
                                       component for transmission to engine.

parser         readMesgField.tcl       Receives incoming message from the
               separateIdName.tcl      uiEngConn component, parses the message,
               parseMesg.tcl           set the appropriate data in the uiValues
                                       component, and call the messageMgr for
                                       proper screen construction.

uiConfig       uiConfig.tcl            Parses command-line, Reads config files,
                                       Creates Options popup, Create Open
                                       and Save Config File Popups. Acts as a
                                       container for the engine host,
                                       engine port, and web browser command.

uiEngConn      uiEngConn.tcl           Transmits and Receives messages from the
                                       Engine. When transmitting a message the
                                       connection is established, the message 
                                       is sent. The component then waits for a
                                       reply. Once a reply is received, the
                                       connection is closed and the message is
                                       sent to the parser component.

uiErrorHandler uiErrorHandler.tcl      Currently has limited functionality,
                                       creates an Error Dialog box with a
                                       message passed in.

uiValues       uiValues.tcl            Container class for containing
                                       information contained in incoming
                                       and outgoing messages. Used for screen
                                       construction by messageMgr and by the
                                       generator for outgoing messages.
                                       
uiTest         uiTest.tcl              A module with is used when the -test
                                       command line argument is specified.
                                       The module is used for screen
                                       construction for screen shots.

mainWin        mainWin.tcl             The module is used for creating the
                                       PML Main Window.

             
               pmlUI.tcl               Main script for starting the PML UI


CURRENT STATUS:

Currently a user can login as user "fred" to the pml engine daemon
running on oslab-server. The user can then select a process to run.

Most messages work between the ui and engine except the ACTION and 
ACTIONRESPONSE message where there are format mismatches. 
The UI can display parts of an pml action message but not all the fields.

This is one issue which needs to be resolved with the engine group.
Perhaps a re-engineering of how pml actions should handled.
